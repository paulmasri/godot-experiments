## The experiments (in created order)

1. Player with rotate and thrust
1. Controls for rotate and thrust
1. Tiled level

## To-do

### Controls for rotate and thrust

- √ Visual indicators of rotate & thrust (sliders)
- √ Keyboard control
- √ Mouse control
- Touch control
- Testing on mobile

### Tiled level

- √ Graphical shapes
- √ Manually create a tiled level
- √ Play test with player
- Encode level as JSON
- Load level and render

## To learn or work out

- What global elements are needed: level, player & things, hub, onboarding/tutorial, pause screen, hud, etc. and how they should be organised in the tree
- Whether to change scene at the SceneTree root or at a subnode when changing level or switching between a level and the hub
